## Docker Image Building
### Building local-python-app
docker build -t local-python-app .


#### Resolved Issues in python dockerfile
| Issue | Resolution | Explanation | Error Screenshot |
|-------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| EXPOSE port in string format | Changed to integer | Docker EXPOSE requires numeric ports, not string values | ![Python Dockerfile EXPOSE Error](./Images/python-expose-error.png) |
| Working directory name | Renamed to app and updated COPY paths | Incorrect working directory caused file not found errors | ![Python Dockerfile Workdir Error](./Images/python-workdir-error.png) |
| Package name typo | Corrected netiface to netifaces | Python package installation failed due to incorrect package name | ![Python Requirements Error](./Images/python-requirements-error.png) |
| CMD spelling | Fixed python spelling | Container failed to start due to incorrect command name | ![Python CMD Error](./Images/python-cmd-error.png) |

### Building local-nginx
docker build -t nginx .


#### Resolved Issues in Nginx dockerfile
| Issue | Resolution | Explanation | Error Screenshot |
|-------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Base image spelling | Corrected latest spelling | Image pull failed due to incorrect tag name | ![NGINX Base Image Error](./Images/nginx-base-error.png) |
| EXPOSE port format | Changed string to integer | NGINX ports must be specified as numbers | ![NGINX EXPOSE Error](./Images/nginx-expose-error.png) |
| COPY command | Fixed source file name | Files weren't copying due to incorrect source path | ![NGINX Copy Error](./Images/nginx-copy-error.png) |
| Redundant COPY | Removed COPY ./html /usr/share/nginx/htmll | Double copying caused conflicts and typo in destination path | ![NGINX Redundant Copy](./Images/nginx-redundant-copy.png) |
| CMD configuration | Updated NGINX run command | NGINX failed to start due to incorrect daemon configuration |

#### Docker Compose Fixes
| Issue | Resolution | Explanation | Error Screenshot |
|-------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Networks configuration | Removed unsupported options block | Docker Compose version doesn't support legacy network options | ![Docker Compose Network Error](./Images/compose-network-error.png) |
| Port formatting | Fixed NGINX port number format | Port mapping syntax was incorrect causing bind failures | ![Docker Compose Port Error](./Images/compose-port-error.png) |
| Volume paths | Corrected volume mapping | Volumes weren't mounting due to incorrect path format |
| Service exposure | Changed expose to ports | Services weren't accessible due to wrong port configuration |
| Network type | Fixed bridge spelling | Network creation failed due to incorrect driver name |
 
### After  building and running the docker compose file I found out the error in the logs of the nginx.
![NGINX Worker Process Error](./Images/nginx-worker-error.png)

### NGINX Configuration
#### Fixed Issues in nginx.conf
| Issue | Resolution | Explanation | Error Screenshot |
|-------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Worker processes | Changed worker_process auto to worker_processes auto; | NGINX failed to start due to missing semicolon and plural form | ![NGINX Worker Process Error](./Images/nginx-worker-error.png) |
| Include directives | Corrected include file references | Configuration loading failed due to incorrect include paths |

### After this I successfully build and run the docker compose file I hosted it on http://localhost:8000/
However as seen in the image the MAC address was wrong and to fix it I looked into the app.py file.

![Python MAC Address Update](./Images/python-mac-update.png)

### Python Application Updates
Modified MAC address retrieval in app.py:

iface = 'eth0'  # Use Docker's main network interface

*Explanation*: Original code failed to retrieve MAC address consistently in Docker environment; eth0 is the standard Docker network interface.

## Application Status
- Successfully built and deployed locally
- Accessible at: http://localhost:8000/
- Ready for AWS deployment

## AWS Deployment
Following successful local testing, the application has been prepared for AWS deployment. Refered to AWS documentation for specific deployment steps in yourÂ environment.
